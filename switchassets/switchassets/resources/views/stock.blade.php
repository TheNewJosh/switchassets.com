                        <p>"In the process of searching for a well-rounded broker, finding the right mix is no easy task.
                            Trade costs, trade platforms, tools, research, and customer service all are important to
                            investors. We are here to end that search and make stock broking less complex and very
                            profitable

                    <p>Whether it be company profiling, advanced earnings analysis, plotting FRED data, charting social
                        sentiment, backtesting and replaying historical markets tick by tick, viewing economic and corporate
                        calendars, creating and conducting real-time stock scans, sharing charts and workspace layouts, or
                        performing advanced options analysis, the rabbit hole goes as far as any trader's imagination will

                        Focusing on two more recent innovations, adding Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) and the new
                        earnings analysis tool, investors can begin to appreciate the endless brain hub stationed at
                        thinkorswimâ€™s Chicago office. Starting with FRED, a publicly accessible US Government database of
                        over 400,000 economic data points; think GDP, CPI, treasury rates, median household income, etc.
                        FRED data is used by institutional investors, hedge funds, and other sophisticated trading
                        operations. In its never-ending quest to level the playing field, the thinkorswim team decided to
                        download all the data, process it, build a custom interface to graph it, and brought it to all TD
                        Ameritrade clients
